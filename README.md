# Background of the Game
Aram was an orphan, he was abused all the time in the orphanage. Other kids would beat him up and pick on him. One day an old guy came to the orphanage to adopt him, finally I get to leave this place and things will finally be better he said. Little did he know that old man who adopted him was even more abusive. One day he saw on tv Harambe the heroic gorilla who was shot. He didn't see Harambe as a wild animal, he saw an animal who only wanted to protect the child and actually died for the child. To him Harambe was what he always wanted. Harambe was the parental figure that he longed for. On the eve of that night the old man who adopted him came home drunk, he got mad because Aram was watching TV so the old man got a bottle and smashed it into the side of Aram’s head. This caused Aram to fall into a comatose and is stuck forever in a dream where he tries to get to heaven to get to Harambe but he will never be able to do so. Aram will be stuck in a loop of escalating anticipation, with a longing that will never be fulfilled.
